## Inspiration
####  As students, we feel it is important to be paired in groups with reason, which is why we developed RePair. Our goal is to reduce the stress students experience when tasked with forming their own group for projects. RePair is an intuitive group-assignment program developed by students with the intention of producing well-balanced teams for school projects.

## What it does 
#### To use RePair, the teacher first completes a form with some general information about themselves and their course. Once their course is in the database, the students fill out the student form with their work preferences and provide valuable data that will impact who they are paired with. While COVID-19 is still spreading, it is important to give students the option to meet virtually if they feel more comfortable with that. Because of this, we allow students to choose whether they want to meet in person or virtually, and they also get to pick whether they would prefer to work in the morning, afternoon, or night. The remaining fields are a scale of how outgoing they are, and what their current grade in the class is. Once the student information is collected, teachers will be able to view the results of our pairing algorithm and filter it by different preferences. For example, a teacher can choose to pair people based on contrasting social engagement levels to try and promote an inclusive classroom where everyone can feel involved.  

## Why use RePair? 
#### RePair is beneficial to both the students AND their teachers, and levels the playing field for group projects by promoting an inclusive environment for students. In creating teams, RePair considers factors such as classmate current grade, preferred meeting time/location, basic strengths, and more!

## How we built it
#### We built the website using html, CSS, and JavaScript. To integrate the form content into the database, we used PHP and PostgreSQL. To write the pairing algorithm, we used C.
